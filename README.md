# Problem Domain
Do you need help moving? mowing your lawn? setting up ikea furniture? There are not a lot of options to find handy help. Our application can assist you in your search to find handy people across the nation! Our application will allow a user to login or sign up using an Oauthorization process, once in our application that user will be able to post job requests. They will be able to have a role that can create a job, update the information, or delete the job posting. Other users are able to browse the job postings and "bid" to do the job.
Job management and bidding system
Our project aims to allow users to be able to post jobs. Other users can then post a bid to do the job. The creator can accept bids and then close the job.The user has privileges over their own jobs. Admin users also exist and have privileges to all jobs.
